# WEBY


This is a Project for Web Development class 

I tried to make a Restaurant Web aplication, where the user can look at the menue and make a reservation or send a email to the staff.
Also the Admin has the ability to login and edit/delete the reservations and also respond tho the emails that they have recived.

In this project I used CSS, HTML, PHP and JS
I also used Flight PHP, Composer, bootstap library and jquery
